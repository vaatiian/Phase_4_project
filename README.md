2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The web application or API developed as part of the project should provide a user-friendly interface for obtaining DJIA predictions. Users should find it intuitive and easy to navigate.

By meeting these success criteria, the project aims to showcase the efficiency of machine learning in providing valuable insights into stock market movements.

## Methodology

### Research Questions

The project addresses the following research questions:

1. Can historical data from Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) be used to predict future market trends accurately?

2. What key features or indicators contribute significantly to predicting stock market movements?

3. Which machine learning algorithms are best suited for predicting DJIA movement?

### Hypothesis

The project operates under the following hypotheses:

1. Historical trends and patterns in Dow Jones data can be leveraged to forecast future market trends with reasonable accuracy.

2. Technical indicators like moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and MACD will be crucial features for predicting stock market trends.

3. Time series forecasting models like ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet will outperform basic regression models in predicting stock market movements.

## Research Design

The project employs an analytical approach by applying various machine-learning models to historical Dow Jones data. Emphasis is placed on time series analysis methodologies to capture the sequential nature of stock market data.

## Data Description

### Data Source

The project utilizes data collected from the investing.com website, covering historical data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from 01/03/2000 to 11/24/2023. The dataset includes attributes such as Date, Close, Open, High, Low, Volume, and Change %.

The project involves the training and evaluation of several machine learning models, including an ARIMA model, a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network, and the Prophet time series forecasting model. The models are assessed based on accuracy, root mean squared error (RMSE), and other relevant metrics.

The LSTM model exhibits the lowest RMSE(895.121) among the presented models, emphasizing its potential for capturing long-term dependencies in the data.

Prophet, with its higher RMSE among the presented models, indicates a less accurate short-term forecasting performance. While Prophet may provide valuable insights, especially in capturing seasonality and holidays, it appears to be less suitable for achieving the precision required in short-term predictions compared to ARIMA Model with an RMSE(933.766).


In summary, based on the results, the LSTM model, trained for 20 epochs, achieved the lowest RMSE of 895.121, indicating better performance compared to the ARIMA and Prophet models. The ARIMA model follows with an RMSE of 933.766, while the Prophet model shows a higher RMSE of 1549.156.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the LSTM model stands out as the optimal choice for investors prioritizing precise short-term predictions, evident from its consistently low RMSE. While ARIMA remains valuable for capturing specific short-term trends, the robust performance of LSTM positions it as the preferred model. To enhance predictive capabilities, combining LSTM with complementary models such as ARIMA is recommended. This strategic diversification, integrating machine learning predictions with fundamental and technical analyses, equips investors with a comprehensive approach for effective portfolio management and informed decision-making.

## Recommendations

- **Leverage LSTM Model:** Investors should capitalize on the consistently accurate predictions of the LSTM Model, evident in its low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for DJIA movements. The LSTM model excels in both short-term precision and capturing long-term dependencies, making it a robust choice for comprehensive market forecasting.
